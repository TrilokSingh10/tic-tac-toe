Gameplay Instructions

The game starts with Player X.

Players take turns clicking on an empty cell to mark their symbol (X or O).

The game checks for a winner or a draw after every move:

Win: A player wins if they align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Draw: If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

After a win or a draw, the game automatically resets for a new round.
